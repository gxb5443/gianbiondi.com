                                Principal Engineer Walmart is one of the largest retailers in the United States and the world.
After leaving Swap Health, I decided to take some time to figure out what to do next. I remembered fondly my time with Walmart in the past and decided to apply. I wanted to leverage my experience in health care and continue to help people. Walmart hired me in their Pharamacy and Vision department as a Principal Engineer.
My role as a Principal engineer has me working on all sorts of projects. I am currently helping the team modernize our existing systems, as well as helping break into new lines of business. I evaluate designs for effectiveness, performance, cost, and maintainability. All the while I&rsquo;m mentoring more junior engineers and promoting engineering excellence across our entire pillar.

                                <h1>CTO - Swap Health</h1>
                                Co-Founder and CTO My former boss from my DoubleVerify days, a serious and serial entrepreneur, reached out to me during the spring of 2021 with a question: what if we could help people make better choices while grocery shopping? I thought the idea was really interesting, we could apply a lot of the advertising techniques and technology towards helping people get healthier. Over the next week I built out a prototype chrome extension that could analyze products and make recommendations for people shopping for groceries online. And just like that I co-founded a Health Tech startup.
From POCs to pilots, I built and managed all the technology that powered Swap Health. I built the backend and core technology, and managed teams of contractors to implement a polished and user-friendly Google Chrome Browser Extension and Ionic App.
Our company focused on managing chronic conditions by changing their behavior to make better choices for their health. Our first product was a Google Chrome Browser Extension (since deprecated) which would assist users as they shop for groceries online. As users navigated the grocer&rsquo;s website, the extension would analyze the page and identify products, surfacing small hints and advice about the products and recommend alternative, healthier products.
Out of the extension came a mobile-app which allows users to take our healthy intelligence into physical stores. The app allows users to browse through our database of products, build shopping lists with the help of our Shopping Assistant, and scan product barcodes for real time analysis. It also allowed users to schedule and communicate with their human dietitians through integration with our EMR system.
In addition to pure engineering, I was also in charge of operational tasks including compliance (HIPAA) and insurance. I also participated heavily in the fundraising process and getting our first pre-seed investment from 25madison Health

                                Staff Engineer and Fortune 1 Company Walmart is one of the largest retailers in the United States and the world.
When Walmart fully absorbed Jet.com, my team from Jet was merged with another team working for Walmart Labs proper. We brought much of our experience with our A/B testing platform to the Walmart-developed tool. We brought A/B testing to all of Walmart, including in-store operations. Together we built a single, performant platform that supported a growing culture of testing and optimization at Walmart. I also led efforts to upgrade our internal telemetry system to use OpenTelemetry. I also led experiments and research into improving user experience through new integrations and work flows (e.g. GitOps-based experiments) and in upgrading our platform to a next-generation architecture built on edge-computing via Web Assembly.

I worked on our internally-developed A/B testing platform. The platform was built directly into the network infrastructure of Jet, injecting metadata and dynamically updating routing for every request. The tech stack we used was React, Node, Golang, and Lua. I quickly rose through the ranks to the team&rsquo;s technical lead and was promoted to Staff Engineer.

                                Leading Research and Learning Scale DoubleVerify is a software company which produces tools for advertisers, marketplaces, and publishers to better understand how their ad&rsquo;s performance. DoubleVerify focused on detecting and preventing fraud, measuring &ldquo;viewability&rdquo;, and ensuring brand-safety.
I was the first engineering hire for a special research project to build a product to help publishers and work with ad-blockers to ensure well-behaved ads could be shown to users.
After that project, I joined the team that worked on integration with marketplaces. When an advertiser is using a marketplace they engage in high-speed bidding that occurs within 10&rsquo;s of milliseconds. In that time DoubleVerify must provide analysis to the bidding agents so they can better assess the quality of an ad space and bid more effectively. Through this I got my first real experience with truely &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo;. We used Kafka to process impressions from social media sources and move them into our data lake for analysis and exploration. I gained a ton of SQL experience, upgrading and maintaining legacy systems which required huge and complex ETL processes.

                                First Start-up Experience Namely was a start-up focusing on HR and Payroll.
I was hired through a forum for Golang developers. I was self-taught in the technology and very excited about it. I was hired as their first engineer versed in Golang. The plan was to start to build-up and multi-technology team and break up our existing Ruby-on-Rails Monolith into Golang and Ruby microservices. The first project in this effort was building a service which managed our customer database and enabled queries for current data as well as historical data.
After this project, I became a founding member of the &ldquo;Core Services&rdquo; team which focused on building microservices for common and critical functions like Auth and User Management. I was the main architect for much of this effort.

                                Working with atoms While I was in university, I got a job working with Princeton University at the Plasma Physics Research Lab. I worked on a system called the Miniature Integrated Nuclear Detection System (MINDS) which was used heavily by the United States Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Energy. This was my first experience with artifical intelligence systems. I got to maintain the linux system and C++ program powering the device as well as maintaining the scintillator hardware of the detection device. I spent time working with low-level nuclear materials for testing and demonstrations.
I used this experience to get an internship with the lab working on the construction of the NCSX experimental nuclear fusion reactor. Unfortunately I was the last person hired for the project, as it was shortly cancelled after my arrival. However I did get really interesting experience working with metrology techniques including photogrammetry, laser tracking, and ultrasonic systems. The reactor&rsquo;s design was generated by a computer and the tolerances were very tight so during the construction process it was very important we stayed within those tight tolerances.

                                Hardware Engineering with USAF I worked with the USAF out of a depot in Warner Robins, GA. I got the job through a scholarship program I received while in university. Working at this job was exciting and very rewarding. I got some unique experience working with military hardware and software. I worked on troubleshooting GPS high precision timing interface, and got build some tooling to communicate with the units. I also worked on reverse engineering and upgrading the landing gear sequence control system using VHDL, including testing procedures and other documentation.
