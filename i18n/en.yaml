    <p>
      I'm easy going, curious, a fast-learner, and a natural leader.
      I do what I love and I love what I do. I lead by example and I love
      to work side-by-side with my teams.

    <br/>

      My profile is a mix of highly technical 
      as well as leadership experience. I bring 
      business and product vision to tech teams, 
      partly thanks to having started my own company. 
      I love exploring how technology can improve the 
      users experience in all sorts of ways. I have a 
      strong motivation and sense of responsibility to
      myself, my team, and clients.

    <br/>

      On the technical side, I have a wide array of 
      experience in different areas, such as mobile and 
      web development; big data; devops; internal tooling; 
      and more. I love learning new technology and tackling 
      interesting problems. I have a strong background in 
      computer science and engineering, and I am always looking 
      for new challenges and a chance to step out of my comfort zone.
