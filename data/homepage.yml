  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead"> I’m a very easy going, sociable, fast-learner, curious and natural leader. I do what I love, and I love what I do. I lead by example and work side by side with my teams. </p> <p class="lead"> My profile is a hybrid of technical and managerial experience, but always related to technological projects. I bring business and product vision to tech teams, partly thanks to having started an developed a company. I am a fast learner, curious to see how technology can improve the users experience in multiple areas. I have a strong motivation and sense of responsibility with myself, my team and clients (or peers), and people like my positive and easy going, can-do attitude. </p> <p class="lead"> On the technical side, I’m a <em>specialized generalist</em>, always working between different areas, such as mobile and web development, devops, team leading... This has involved a variety of languages and frameworks in the web-side, both in the backend and in the client side. </p>'
