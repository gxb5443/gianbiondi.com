  content: |
    <p class="lead">
      Iâ€™m easy going, curious, a fast-learner and a natural leader. 
      I do what I love, and I love what I do. I lead by example and love to work side by side with my teams. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead"> 
      My profile is a mix of highly technical as well as leadership experience. 
      I bring business and product vision to tech teams, partly thanks to having started my own company. 
      I love exploring how technology can improve the users experience in all sorts of ways. 
      I have a strong motivation and sense of responsibility with myself, my team, and clients.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      On the technical side, I have a wide array of experience in different areas, such as mobile and web development; 
      big data; devops; internal tooling; and more. I love learning new technology and tackling
      interesting problems. I have a strong background in computer science and engineering, and I am always looking for
      new challenges and a chance to step out of my comfort zone.
