### Leading Research and Learning Scale

DoubleVerify is a software company which produces tools for advertisers, marketplaces, and publishers to better understand how their ad's performance. DoubleVerify focused on detecting and preventing fraud, measuring "viewability", and ensuring brand-safety.

I was the first engineering hire for a special research project to build a product to help publishers and work with ad-blockers to ensure well-behaved ads could be shown to users.

After that project, I joined the team that worked on integration with marketplaces. When an advertiser is using a marketplace they engage in high-speed bidding that occurs within 10's of milliseconds. In that time DoubleVerify must provide analysis to the bidding agents so they can better assess the quality of an ad space and bid more effectively. Through this I got my first real experience with truely "Big Data". We used Kafka to process impressions from social media sources and move them into our data lake for analysis and exploration. I gained a ton of SQL experience, upgrading and maintaining legacy systems which required huge and complex ETL processes.
