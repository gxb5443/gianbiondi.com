### Hardware Engineering with USAF

I worked with the USAF out of a depot in Warner Robins, GA. I got the job through a scholarship program I received while in university.
Working at this job was exciting and very rewarding. I got some unique experience working with military hardware and software.
I worked on troubleshooting GPS high precision timing interface, and got build some tooling to communicate with the units.
I also worked on reverse engineering and upgrading the landing gear sequence control system using VHDL, including testing procedures and other documentation.
