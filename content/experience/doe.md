### Working with atoms

While I was in university, I got a job working with Princeton University at the Plasma Physics Research Lab.
I worked on a system called the Miniature Integrated Nuclear Detection System (MINDS) which was used heavily
by the United States Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Energy. This was my first experience
with artifical intelligence systems. I got to maintain the linux system and C++ program powering the device as well
as maintaining the scintillator hardware of the detection device. I spent time working with low-level nuclear materials
for testing and demonstrations.

I used this experience to get an internship with the lab working on the construction of the NCSX experimental
nuclear fusion reactor. Unfortunately I was the last person hired for the project, as it was shortly cancelled after my arrival.
However I did get really interesting experience working with metrology techniques including photogrammetry, laser tracking, and ultrasonic systems. The reactor's design was generated by a computer and the tolerances were very tight so during the construction process it was very important we stayed within those tight tolerances.
