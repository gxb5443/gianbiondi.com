### Co-Founder and CTO

My former boss from my DoubleVerify days, a serious and serial entrepreneur, reached out to me during the spring of 2021 with a question: what if we could help people make better choices while grocery shopping? I thought the idea was really interesting, we could apply a lot of the advertising techniques and technology towards helping people get healthier. Over the next week I built out a prototype chrome extension that could analyze products and make recommendations for people shopping for groceries online. And just like that I co-founded a Health Tech startup.

From POCs to pilots, I built and managed all the technology that powered Swap Health. I built the backend and core technology, and managed teams of contractors to implement a polished and user-friendly Google Chrome Browser Extension and [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) App.

Our company focused on managing chronic conditions by changing their behavior to make better choices for their health. Our first product was a Google Chrome Browser Extension (since deprecated) which would assist users as they shop for groceries online. As users navigated the grocer's website, the extension would analyze the page and identify products, surfacing small hints and advice about the products and recommend alternative, healthier products.

Out of the extension came a mobile-app which allows users to take our healthy intelligence into physical stores. The app allows users to browse through our database of products, build shopping lists with the help of our Shopping Assistant, and scan product barcodes for real time analysis. It also allowed users to schedule and communicate with their human dietitians through integration with our EMR system.

In addition to pure engineering, I was also in charge of operational tasks including compliance (HIPAA) and insurance. I also participated heavily in the fundraising process and getting our first [pre-seed investment from 25madison Health](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221103006115/en/Swap-Health-Launches-Out-of-Stealth-With-Investment-from-25m-Health-Partnership-with-University-of-Florida)
