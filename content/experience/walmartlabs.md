### Staff Engineer and Technical Lead

Walmart is one of the largest retailers in the United States and the world.

I was hired originally at Jet.com, an acquisition of Walmart. I worked on our internally-developed A/B testing platform. The platform was built directly into the network infrastructure of Jet, injecting metadata and dynamically updating routing for every request. The tech stack we used was React, Node, Golang, and Lua. I quickly rose through the ranks to become the team's technical lead.

When Walmart fully absorbed Jet.com, my team was merged with another team working for Walmart Labs proper. We brought much of our experience with our A/B testing platform to the Walmart-developed tool. We brought A/B testing to all of walmart, including in-store operations. Together we built a single, performant platform that supported a growing culture of testing and optimization at Walmart. I also led efforts to upgrade our internal telemetry system to use [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), and led experiments and research into improving user experience through new integrations and work flows (e.g. GitOps) and in upgrading our platform to a next-generation architecture built on edge-computing via Web Assembly.
