### Principal Engineer

Walmart is one of the largest retailers in the United States and the world.

After leaving Swap Health, I decided to take some time to figure out what to do next.
I remembered fondly my time with Walmart in the past and decided to apply. I wanted to
leverage my experience in health care and continue to help people. Walmart hired me
in their Pharamacy and Vision department as a Principal Engineer.

My role as a Principal engineer has me working on all sorts of projects. I am currently
helping the team modernize our existing systems, as well as helping break into new lines
of business. I evaluate designs for effectiveness, performance, cost, and maintainability.
All the while I'm mentoring more junior engineers and promoting engineering excellence
across our entire pillar.
