### First Start-up Experience

Namely was a start-up focusing on HR and Payroll.

I was hired through a forum focusing on Golang. I was self-taught in the technology and very excited about it. I was hired as their first engineer versed in Golang. The plan was to start to break up our existing Ruby-on-Rails Monolith into Golang and Ruby microservices. The first project in this effort was building a service which managed our customer database and enabled queries for current data as well as historical data.

After this project, I became a founding member of the "Core Services" team which focused on building microservices for common and critical functions like Auth and User Management. I was the main architect for much of this effort.
