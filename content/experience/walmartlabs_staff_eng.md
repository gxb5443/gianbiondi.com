### Staff Engineer and Fortune 1 Company

Walmart is one of the largest retailers in the United States and the world.

When Walmart fully absorbed Jet.com, my team from Jet was merged with another team working for Walmart Labs proper. We brought much of our experience with our A/B testing platform to the Walmart-developed tool. We brought A/B testing to all of Walmart, including in-store operations. Together we built a single, performant platform that supported a growing culture of testing and optimization at Walmart. I also led efforts to upgrade our internal telemetry system to use [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/). I also led experiments and research into improving user experience through new integrations and work flows (e.g. GitOps-based experiments) and in upgrading our platform to a next-generation architecture built on edge-computing via Web Assembly.
