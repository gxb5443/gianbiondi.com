### Senior Engineer and Technical Lead

I was hired originally at Jet.com as a Senior Engineer. Walmart acquired Jet shortly before I was hired. I worked on our internally-developed A/B testing platform. The platform was built directly into the network infrastructure of Jet, injecting metadata and dynamically updating routing for every request. The tech stack we used was React, Node, Golang, and Lua. I quickly rose through the ranks to the team's technical lead and was promoted to Staff Engineer.
